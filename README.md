**Digital Gardening Journal**
*This app is created to give gardeners a digital place to plan, organize, and document their gardens from year to year.  It solves the problem of having notebooks filled with information with no way to easily recall or search.  It is also more eco friendly with less waste.*

**Technologies Used**
-Express backend
-MongoDB
-Mongoose

**Notes**
*This is a two part repository.  There is another for the front end with the same naming convention.*

*I anticipate some time to be spent seeding a minimal starter API.  There was no useful API for garden plants that I could find so I started out with ChatGPT giving me the 10 most popular annual and perennial garden plants with the info that I needed.*

*There are no stretch features planned for the backend of this project*
